## 2026-09-26 — STEP 0 done, starting STEP 1

**Branch:** `feature/jenny-audit`
**Phase:** STEP 0 complete. Starting STEP 1 (contract tests + `JENNY-ARENA-CONTRACT.md`).

**Done:**
- Corrected mission docs committed: `docs/JENNYSOL-MISSION-2.md`, `docs/JENNYSOL-MISSION-ADDENDUM.md`, `docs/JENNYSOL-FINISH-ALL.md`, `docs/VIKISOL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md`.
- Key correction folded in: the Arena↔Jenny gateway (`routes/agentGateway.ts`, `productConnectors/arena.ts`) is **already live in production**, not a Phase-6 deliverable to build. Verified end to end against `api-arena.vikisol.in` on 2026-09-26 (see prior session's live-check transcript — a real activity was found, proposed, approved, and the room opened).
- Baseline verified before starting: `npx vitest run` → 682 passed, 2 skipped, 69 files. `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` clean (server + client). Tip `33abb27`, fully pushed to `main`.

**Next:** STEP 1 — write/extend contract tests for the live gateway (propose→approve→execute, single-use, 5-min expiry, scope checks, forged/expired/reused rejection), rate the 5 write tools (High: `placeBid`, `applyToJob`; Medium: `createPost`, `createProject`), and write `docs/JENNY-ARENA-CONTRACT.md` for Cursor.

**Open questions for the founder:** none yet — nothing has been blocking so far. Anything that blocks goes to `docs/BLOCKERS.md`, not here.

**Note to Cursor:** I am not touching any Arena repo. If you need something from JennySol's side (a new gateway field, a new tool, a contract change), it goes in `docs/JENNY-ARENA-CONTRACT.md` as a proposal — I'll pick it up from there, not from your repo.
